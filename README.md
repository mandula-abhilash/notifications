# Notifications


### Project Overview

Notifications is a full-stack application designed to demonstrate real-time communication and notification distribution across a distributed system. Utilizing a combination of Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, RabbitMQ, and Redis, this project showcases how different technologies can work together to provide a robust solution for real-time, scalable, and distributed web applications.

#### Key Features
- **Real-Time Communication**: Utilizes Socket.IO for real-time bi-directional communication between clients and servers.
- **Distributed Message Distribution**: Leverages RabbitMQ as a message broker to efficiently distribute messages across multiple server instances.
- **Session Management**: Employs Redis for consistent session management across a distributed system, ensuring a seamless user experience across multiple devices or browser tabs.
- **Scalability**: Demonstrates a scalable architecture that can handle increasing load by adding more server instances.
- **Simplified Frontend Interaction**: Includes a simple React-based frontend to interact with the system and visualize real-time notifications.

#### Architecture
- **Backend**: A Node.js/Express application that integrates Socket.IO for WebSocket communication. It interfaces with RabbitMQ for message distribution and uses Redis for session management.
- **RabbitMQ**: Serves as a message broker, relaying messages from the backend to the appropriate client sessions connected to different server instances.
- **Redis**: Manages user sessions, allowing the backend to retrieve and store session data regardless of which server instance a client is connected to.
- **Frontend**: A React application that connects to the backend via WebSockets, enabling users to initiate operations and receive real-time notifications.

#### Use Case
This setup is ideal for scenarios where a user initiates a time-intensive operation, and the status of this operation needs to be communicated in real-time across all the user's active sessions, including different browsers and devices.

#### How to Run
1. **Backend Setup**:
   - Ensure RabbitMQ and Redis are installed and running on your server.
   - Navigate to the `backend` directory and run `npm run server`.

2. **Frontend Setup**:
   - In the `frontend` directory, run `npm run start`.

#### Testing
- Open the frontend application in multiple tabs or on different devices.
- Use the interface to initiate operations and observe real-time updates across all sessions.

#### Future Enhancements
- Implement additional security measures for production deployment.
- Extend the frontend to include more interactive features.
- Add functionality for user authentication and personalized notifications.
